The code in `main.py` demonstrates how to list, create, or delete repositories from within Python
using GitHub's REST API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos

You need your own GitHub `Personal Access Token` to make all requests.
You can create it in your GitHub account under `Settings` -> `Deveoper Settings` -> `Personal Access Tokens` -> `Tokens (classic)`.

Required Python package: `requests`

        python -m pip install requests
